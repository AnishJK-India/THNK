THNK now has a website!

It is built upon Docusaurus 2.0, and will be home to the documentation and the blog/devlog of THNK. You can submit modifications to it via GitHub, and are welcome to help. I hope to achieve to build together a quality resource for understanding THNK.

That's it for now, there is not much to say yet. See you later for more ðŸ˜‰!
